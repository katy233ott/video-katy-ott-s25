        <h1>The Iron Archives: Powerlifitng PRs That Deserve a Medal, a Chriopractor, and Probably a Priest</h1>
        <p>Welcome to The Iron Archives - where plates are heavy, egos are heavier, and belts are tighter than your last deadlift lockout. This page is a celebration of lifters chasing that sweet PR high, breaking parallel (sometimes), and leaving their souls on the platform. No rep? No problem. We've got chalk, memes, and max effort energy to spare.</p>

          <h2>Bench Press Battles - Chesticles in Charge</h2>
          <p>Ah yes, the Monday tradtion. Watch gym warriors test their triceps, trust issues, and ability to yell "It's all you, bro!" while clearly helping. From t-rex arms to bench arch acrobatics, these lifters are pushing the bar - and the boundaries of proper form.</p>

          <h2>Deadlift Drama - Grip It, Rip It, Regret It</h2>
          <p>If deadlifts had a Tinder bio, it would say: "Will ruin your shins and your weekend plans." These lifters said "what lower back?" and went all in. Whther it's sumo, conventional, or "is that even legal?", prepare for some spinal wizardy and forhead veins that deserve their own Instagram.</p>

          <h2>Squat Showdowns - Depth Optional, Hype Required</h2>
          <p>You haven't lived until you've seen a squat that starts strong and ends in a prayer. These clips showcase quad carnage, hip mobility miracles, and spotters trying their best. Some break parallel. Others break hearts. All are epic.</p>
